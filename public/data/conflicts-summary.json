    "description": "<p>Foreign policy communities in open societies love to debate their own relevance. Analysts quarrel over whether their insights inform statecraft or merely decorate it, and governments alternately embrace and ignore them depending on the moment. One might assume that in China this dynamic hardly exists, that an authoritarian system simply compels its experts to fall in line and rewards those who echo the leadership&#8217;s priorities.The reality is more complicated. China&#8217;s foreign policy experts neither operate in lockstep with the state nor stand wholly apart from it. As I discuss in my new book, their influence rises and falls with their</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2025/12/do-chinas-foreign-policy-experts-matter-how/\">Do China’s Foreign Policy Experts Matter?

    "description": "<p>America&#8217;s greatest national security threat is an enemy born from and nurtured by the Pentagon: crippling bureaucracy. It starves the oxygen from good ideas, good people, and good technologies while creating ideal conditions for mediocrity to thrive. It has permeated every corner of the system, including the defense-sponsored innovation initiatives &#8212; like the Small Business Innovation Research Program &#8212; that purportedly exist as its counter.In 1982, President Ronald Reagan signed the Small Business Innovation Development Act, creating the Small Business Innovation Research program.

    "description": "<p>Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman&#8217;s recent White House visit has crystallized a fundamental shift in U.S.-Saudi relations: Washington no longer has the leverage to demand Saudi normalization with Israel.After the Biden administration distanced itself from Riyadh following the 2018 Jamal Khashoggi killing, Washington has now recalibrated. This was driven not by diplomacy or values alignment but by structural pressures, including the political blowback that Washington has faced for its military and diplomatic support for Israel&#8217;s Gaza campaign, which strained U.S. credibility across the region. Key to these structural pressures were supply-chain vulnerabilities exposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, the shock</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2025/12/the-u-s-saudi-reconfiguration-is-real-and-it-no-longer-depends-on-israel/\">The U.S.-Saudi Reconfiguration Is Real and It No Longer Depends on Israel</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com\">War on the Rocks</a>.</p>\n"

They assumed he would conclude that the costs of heavy Western sanctions, together with the risk of significant battlefield casualties, outweighed the potential gains.Many analysts and observers underestimated the likelihood of invasion in part because they modeled Russia as a typical state in which</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2025/12/why-many-underestimated-russias-invasion-risk/\">Why Many Underestimated Russia’s Invasion Risk</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com\">War on the Rocks</a>.</p>\n"

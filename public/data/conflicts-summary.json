    "description": "<p>Planners today struggle to properly apply operational art in large scale war &#8212; and they don&#8217;t fully realize why. It takes something like firsthand experience in a strategic level wargame against a human red team to fully realize how much understanding of classical military art has been lost.The 21st century has witnessed the resurgence of great-power competition, with the Indo-Pacific theater emerging as a focal point for geopolitical rivalry between the United States and China. The increasing complexity of warfare, characterized by rapid technological advancements and emerging multi-domain operations, places unprecedented demands on military planners and strategists.

    "description": "<p>Editor&#8217;s note: This is the first article in a two-part series exploring additive manufacturing.The Pentagon has poured unprecedented funds into additive manufacturing as a potential game-changer for defense production. For example, in fiscal year 2024, the Department of Defense allocated roughly $800 million for additive, which was a 166% increase from the prior year. By FY2026, projects involving 3D printing will swell to an estimated $3.3 billion, based on the budget request. That may sound enormous, but it is still only a small fraction of a research, development, test, and evaluation budget north of $100 billion. The appeal makes sense</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2025/12/the-additive-manufacturing-mirage-in-defense/\">The Additive Manufacturing Mirage in Defense</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com\">War on the Rocks</a>.</p>\n"

    "description": "<p>Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman&#8217;s recent White House visit has crystallized a fundamental shift in U.S.-Saudi relations: Washington no longer has the leverage to demand Saudi normalization with Israel.After the Biden administration distanced itself from Riyadh following the 2018 Jamal Khashoggi killing, Washington has now recalibrated. This was driven not by diplomacy or values alignment but by structural pressures, including the political blowback that Washington has faced for its military and diplomatic support for Israel&#8217;s Gaza campaign, which strained U.S. credibility across the region. Key to these structural pressures were supply-chain vulnerabilities exposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, the shock</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2025/12/the-u-s-saudi-reconfiguration-is-real-and-it-no-longer-depends-on-israel/\">The U.S.-Saudi Reconfiguration Is Real and It No Longer Depends on Israel</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com\">War on the Rocks</a>.</p>\n"
